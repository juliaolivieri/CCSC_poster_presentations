2,2,4,4,2,2,fun topics,1,1,1,3,1,1,2,I liked seeing my work on paper,1,
1,2,3,4,3,4,Choosing a topic I identify with helped motivate me to engage. ,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,I feel like having both platforms were the most beneficial because I needed to analyze my project in multiple ways. ,3,I honestly wouldn’t change a thing. 
1,1,4,4,4,4,,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,,1,
1,3,3,3,3,3,One thing that felt less engaging and harder to present was the amount of surrounded noise. It was difficult to talk to the audience when others were speaking,1,1,2,1,1,2,3,I enjoyed the poster presentation because I've never done one before and taught me to talk to my audience one on one more,3,Space for poster presentation to talk to audience
1,2,2,4,3,4,"Viewing a poster presentation will generally be more engaging, however if it is too hard to hear the poster presenter, it becomes too difficult to stay engaged, as I can’t hear the information being told to me compared to a powerpoint presentation.",2,2,3,2,1,1,2,,3,
1,2,3,3,3,4,"The short presentation times made me feel more engaged, but repeated short presentations made me feel less engaged.",3,1,3,2,2,3,3,,3,I think having more 4 poster boards per table would make it feel less crowded.
1,3,4,3,2,3,"I really loved the conversation and casual aspect of the poster presentations. I felt more engaged since we were kind of forced to talk to others, but it was an overall positive experience! It was nice talking to the people in the class even though I haven’t talked to anyone else, and it seemed like everyone put in the work when it came to this project.",1,1,2,3,1,1,1,"I was definitely less prepared for the poster presentation, but I felt at ease since it was more conversational and casual. It was a great time to experience the poster presentation and work on both my presentation and conversational skills.",3,I think it was nice to have experienced both; having a slide presentation is normal but having it before the poster presentation helped prepare me for the poster and felt less anxious about it.
2,3,3,3,4,4,The poster presentation got pretty loud at times making it harder to engage ,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,,3,
3,3,4,4,4,4,I feel that my graphs needed work. Some questions were unclarified due to lack of graph clarification. ,2,1,2,1,1,1,2,I love the poster presentation. I would love to do it again.,1,No improvements. I loved this class.
1,1,3,4,4,4,,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,,3,
1,3,4,4,3,3,For the poster presentations it took a lot of stress away being more one on one and not everyone just staring at you but did get somewhat repetitive towards the end where as slides youre just nervous the whole time and stuttering and making errors you might not make individually,3,1,3,2,1,1,2,,1,
2,2,3,3,2,4,"overall very interesting and nice to get one on one data, however it was a bit long so many decreasing times for future reference could help engagement and minimize side trackinf",1,2,3,1,1,2,1,"i enjoyed my slide better but when learning from others, I enjoyed posters better",2,
1,2,4,3,3,4,When you are right next to the presenter you should naturally feel the need to be engaged or else you would feel disrespectful so posters really lock you in.     ,3,1,4,1,1,1,1,Well for the slide I presented it only to the professor that is something to note. Posters were definitely more intimate ,3,
1,2,4,3,4,2,,2,2,3,3,1,1,2,,1,
1,2,4,3,2,3,"Being right there with the presenter makes you feel more engaged for sure and especially if it is just you. When the whole class is focusing on one presentation, someone is bound to not be listening and what not. Although for posters it did get quite loud and sometimes I could not hear the presenter. Also for slides it is just like super quiet most likely due to the fact there is only one presenter in the room.",3,1,4,2,1,1,3,The poster presentation challenged me more because I had to present multiple times which made my mouth real dry haha and I observed that explaining the same thing can get tiring and/or weird. I say I get very nervous because I get like panic attacks before and/or during the presentations even though in my mind its alright my body is like no you aren't. I would have been more nervous for the slide presentation because it would have been in front of everyone at once which I feel puts way more pressure but I presented in front of one person. I guess when you are by people who are doing the same thing it kicks off some pressure. I said I learned more from the poster presentations because of the high engagement. I am equally proud of my works but the comparison thief says my poster was not as good compared to others. This was my dose of oversharing.,3,
